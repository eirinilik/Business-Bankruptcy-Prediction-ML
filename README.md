Bankruptcy Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of the Data Mining course at Harokopio University as a group assignment. It focuses on predicting business bankruptcy using financial data from over 10,000 companies. The project includes data preprocessing, classification model training, and feature selection to identify key financial indicators associated with bankruptcy risk.
Dataset

The dataset consists of financial metrics from 7,000 companies between 2000-2007, with 64 financial attributes per company. The target variable indicates whether a company went bankrupt within five years.
Project Workflow

    Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature selection, and data transformation.
    Classification Models – Training various machine learning models for bankruptcy prediction.
    Model Evaluation – Assessing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Feature Importance Analysis – Identifying the most influential financial indicators.
    Predictions – Generating bankruptcy predictions for an unseen test dataset.

Technologies Used
